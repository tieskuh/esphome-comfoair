# Zendher WHR 950
Port of ComfoAir protocol to ESPHome.io firmware originally by @wichers modified by @nyxnyx
to be installed as external_components. Modified for the Zehnder WHR 950 by @tieskuh.
Also confirmed working for the Zehnder WHR 930.

# Configuration
Add to your yaml configuration the definition of `external_components`:
```
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/tieskuh/esphome-comfoair
    components: [comfoair]
    refresh: 0s
```

And than add the uart configuration and component. Pin 22 and 19 are used for the M5Stack Atom Lite with the RS-232 addon. 
For the Atom S3 Lite with the RS-232 addon use rx_pin 5 and tx_pin 6.

```

# Sensors
The following sensors are created in Homeassistant. With the climate entity, it is possible to change the fan speed.

# Hardware
I used the following hardware:
- RS-232 cable with DB9 D-SUB male connector
- M5Stack Atom Lite: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005003299215808.html
  (Atom S3 Lite also confirmed to be working)
- M5Stack RS-232 add-on: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005005933403536.html
- 12v to 5v USB-C adapter: https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/1005004984244010.html

Pin layout:
- RX (receive) = pin 2
- TX (transmit) = pin 3
- GND (ground) = pin 5

(If it doesn't work, try to switch RX and TX. The RX on one end should be the TX on the other end.)

To power the M5Stack, I used a 12v to 5v USB-C adapter and powered the M5Stack via USB-C. There are unused 12v connectors on the WHR's board. Or just use a normal 220v USB adapter.
